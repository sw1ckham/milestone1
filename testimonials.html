The team were brilliant from start to finish and ran like clockwork. Even with bad weather incoming, the project ran on schedule and we didn't have to worry about anything. An extremely high quality build and everything was about what we wanted rather than what the team felt like doing. Very, very happy with the end result."</p>

The produce itself is of good quality and was customised to the way I wanted it i.e. guttering and double doors. The items that come as standard are good e.g. lights and electricity. I was kept informed of progress of my order and emails were responded to immediately. Jon and his team were friendly and professional. I felt I could trust them completely. As I say thoroughly recommend them."</p>

The full installation service covering foundations, the build, electrics, decorating and flooring makes for a hassle free experience.  Jon, Fozzie and the rest of the team take real pride in their work.  Cheerful and friendly, they maintained excellent good humour working in challenging times and conditions (we were re-landscaping as well so they had various obstacles to overcome).  High quality materials and workmanship – highly recommended."</p>

They are friendly, take pride in their work and are easy to communicate with. They were also very clean and took all rubbish away with them. Plus they did a few extra adaptations (extra plug sockets and installation of a ring security camera) without charge. We are very excited to use it to its full potential and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Southwicks. "</p>

I am delighted with my new garden room and it fulfils my expectations. Jon and his team worked hard in extremely cold weather during December 2020 with the finishing touches in January 2021. I am mostly using the garden room for my artwork as well as an office space. Unfortunately, my fuse box was rather old, so I needed to get it replaced prior to the electricity being connected. Jon always responded to e-mails promptly and I would recommend Southwicks to others considering getting a fully-insulated garden room."</p>

They turned up on time, cleaned up after themselves and left on time. We were kept fully up to date throughout the whole process and are very impressed with the quality and workmanship of the end product. If you are looking for a turn-key solution for your garden office needs, you should talk to Southwick’s."</p>

                                    <p>"Jon and his team have been amazing from start to finish. Moving into a new house minus an office
                                        during a pandemic and knowing we needed to build one Southwicks Garden Rooms offer the complete
                                        package and made it so easy from start to finish. Jon took care of everything, liaising with us over
                                        the design but then handling all the different contractors (all great). You might think working from home
                                        with builders on site on and off for a few weeks would be tricky but they are such a great bunch of people
                                        it was a pleasure to have them around, they made it easy. The team are craftsmen who take real pride in their
                                        work, the attention to detail is amazing …and they are incredibly tidy too! We have ended up with something
                                        which just make us go, ‘Wow!’ When we open the curtains in the morning. We refer to it as my shed; but the
                                        little girl who drew pictures of symmetrical houses with flowers at the front gets very excited when
                                        she sees that her shed is really the house she drew as a child. It’s not the sort of thing we usually
                                        do but we love it and it’s already a blessing."</p>

                                        problems, from
                                        start to
                                        finish. Jon, the "boss" was there for most of the build, and he was very
                                        helpful, and
                                        efficient.
                                        The building is very solidly constructed, and I'm sure we will find it very
                                        useful and
                                        practical,
                                        and expect it to last for many years.</p>

                                        we required prior to the build and kept us advised all the way to the finished

                                        Additionally to have it inside the timescale we expected was brilliant!

                                        see. The build

                                        It is everything we wanted and more from a practical level and a peaceful
                                        retreat too.
                                        It was great seeing it go up and we loved how you organised it from start to
                                        finish.
                                        We will definitely recommend you to family and friends.</p>

                                        within the time planned but has totally exceeded our expectations. Its far too

                                        the kids,

                                        Now I have thanks to Jon and Martin. They began on 8th January 2018 and 10 days
                                        later it
                                        was finished.
                                        They were always punctual and they worked efficiently throughout the day. They

                                        and it was the second time I had used them.
                                        In 2013 I used them at my old property and I knew as soon as I moved house I
                                        would be
                                        using them again.
                                        They were incredible from start to finish, so professional and they worked
                                        tirelessly
                                        for the duration of their time with us. The end product

                                    From the start Jon has been very 'hands on' and involved from the initial visit through construction to completion.  
                                    Ably assisted by Martin both were polite, friendly and tidy whilst working with us.  
                                    The end result is exactly what we hoped for.  We have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone considering using Southwicks."</p>
